## Task 1: Number Game
*Date:* July 1, 2024

*Description:* 
- I developed a Number Guessing Game where players try to guess a randomly generated number 
  within a specified range[1-100]. The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too 
  high or too low and continues until the correct number is guessed. I also added features to 
  limit the number of attempts and allow multiple rounds for a more engaging experience.

## Task 2: Student Grade Calculator
*Date:* July 7, 2024

*Description:* 
- In this task, I developed a STUDENT GRADE CALCULATOR where user can input no. of subject and 
  enter all the subject Marks and Calculate Average Percentage and Grades based on the average 
  percentage achieved by user

## Task 3: ATM Interface
*Date:* July 12, 2024

*Description:* 
- Understanding the principles of OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
- Creating classes and objects
- Implementing inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction

*Files:*

## Task 4: Currency Converter
*Date:* July 18, 2024

*Description:* 
- A real-time currency converter using the powerful FastForex.io
  API and Java Swing/AWT for the GUI!

- Currency Selection: Users can effortlessly choose their base and target currencies. 
- Real-Time Rates: Fetches the latest exchange rates from a reliable API. 
- User Input: Accepts user input for the amount they wish to convert. 
- Currency Conversion: Accurately converts the amount using the fetched exchange rate. 
- Display Result: Shows the converted amount along with the target currency 

- This project was a great opportunity to Learn use of API(Application Programming Interface) 
  to fetches real-time-data into a user-friendly application.
