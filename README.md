## Task 1: Number Game
*Date:* July 1, 2024

*Description:* 
- I developed a Number Guessing Game where players try to guess a randomly generated number 
  within a specified range[1-100]. The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too 
  high or too low and continues until the correct number is guessed. I also added features to 
  limit the number of attempts and allow multiple rounds for a more engaging experience.

*Date:* July 7, 2024

*Description:* 
- In this task, I developed a STUDENT GRADE CALCULATOR where user can input no. of subject and 
  enter all the subject Marks and Calculate Average Percentage and Grades based on the average
